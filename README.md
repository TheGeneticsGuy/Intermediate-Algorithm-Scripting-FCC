## MY SOLUTIONS


Each solution includes my own custom submission I completed in my attempt at solving each problem without assistance. They vary in simplicity. They were derived completely on my own, though I did cross-reference the array function tools as a reminder of how to use them, such as map(), split(), etc...

As a demonstration of my solution vs more experienced coders, I added 2 other solutions that are provided by FCC for people that have gotten stuck on the problems. As you can see, sometimes the solutions utilitze the tools much cleaner than I did, though not each solution. I found I would often use raw "for" loops to accomplish the tasks only out of lack of experience with javascript, but as I neared the end, I became a bit more comfortable utilizing them.

I did need to look up some additional tools, as in I was not sure how to convert byte code to the corresponding decimals to so I could determine the chars. The solution was still unique, but the function to convert binary to decimal "parseInt()" I had to reference.
